Come on who don't know the game, I'm pretty sure all of you know it but small overview won't be a problem.

Xs and Os is a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.

The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

You can play it in command line interface (CLI) as cmd in windows or terminal as macOS and GNU/Linux.
